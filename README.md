# Alfred-OpenDL

A simple workflow that does a few things with downloaded files:

- Install the last downloaded file
- Open the last downloaded file
- Install a specific downloaded file
- Open a specific downloaded file

The workflow will automatically mount DMGs and move the enclosed .app file to /Applications. If the DMG includes a .pkg file, it will be opened.
